# Online iStar tool for Neurodivergent accessability, based on piStar

 This is an open-source goal modelling tool. Its key distinguishing characteristics are:
  - it runs entirely on the browser, thus no installation needed
  - high visual fidelity (we want your diagrams to be pretty, even when printed)
  - supports the [iStar 2.0 standard](https://sites.google.com/site/istarlanguage/)
